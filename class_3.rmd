1. What data cleaning/enriching might you need to do

The names need to all be in lowercase. Data types of some columns need to be changed
to numeric. The pct* columns need to be standardized as well.

2. Is it long or wide data and why

This is wide data since the pct* columns can be consolidated into a race/pct
column combination.

3. What data transformation might you need to do

We may have to perform a group-by on the names to choose one among duplicates 
to use as the "main" value for our race identification purposes later.
